\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we propose a neural framework for solving the satisfiability problem. Our framework combines tree 
decomposition and GAT, includes IJGP in the latent space, and performs partition function estimation to solve \#SAT. 
Experimental evaluation on synthetic datasets and existing benchmarks shows that our approach significantly outperforms 
NSNet and other neural baselines and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art solvers.
